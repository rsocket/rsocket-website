The Vanilla RSocket getting started guide overviews key concepts and patterns that you will encounter when working with the various language specific RSocket reference implementations.

### Dependencies

Each language specific RSocket reference implementation requires a number of different dependencies. While these dependencies will differ between the various language specific reference implementations, many common patterns are shared amongst them.

### Connectors (Clients)

Connectors are the primary method for connecting an RSocket Client to an RSocket Server. Each connector implementation is geared towards supporting one of the various transports as described in the [transports protocol](protocol.md#transport-protocol).

The below examples demonstrate creating a RSocket Connector in various languages using the WebSocket transport.

:::info
RSocket has been designed for and tested with TCP, WebSocket, Aeron, and HTTP/2 streams as transport protocols.

### Working with Payloads (data & metadata)

Payloads represent the concept of passing data back and forth between an RSocket Client and an RSocket Server, with a distinction between data and metadata. If we were to relate these concepts to HTTP, then data would represent the HTTP response/request `body,` and metadata would describe the HTTP request/response `headers.`

A single RSocket `payload` is capable of containing both `data` as well as `metadata`, and each can leverage different encodings. For example, an RSocket payload could encode its data as JSON (`application/json`), and its metadata as protobuf (`application/vnd.google.protobuf`).

:::note
It is most common for data and metadata to leverage the same encoding, but is not required.

### Specifying Encoding

Encoding for the data/metadata [frames](protocol.md#framing) in an RSocket payload can be specified when the RSocket Client or RSocket Server is created.
