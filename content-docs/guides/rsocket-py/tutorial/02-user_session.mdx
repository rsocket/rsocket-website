Let's add a server side session to store the logged-in user's state. Later on it will be used to temporarily store
the messages which will be delivered to the client.

## Server side

### Data-classes

First we will add some [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) to represent a single user session, and a lookup dictionary for all user sessions
by their id.

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Dict
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary

class SessionId(str):
    pass

@dataclass()
class UserSessionData:
    username: str
    session_id: SessionId

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ChatData:
    user_session_by_id: Dict[SessionId, UserSessionData] = field(default_factory=WeakValueDictionary)

chat_data = ChatData()
```

The `SessionId` defined in *Lines 5-6* is required in order to store the string session-id as a [weak reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html) later on.

*Lines 8-11* define the `UserSessionData` dataclass which represents the user's session. It contains two fields:
- `username` - Human readable name specified in the login payload.
- `session_id` - unique id (e.g. UUID4) generated to identify the session.

*Lines 13-15* define the `ChatData` dataclass which represents the application's data. For now, it contains only a dict for looking up
user sessions by their id. It is initialized as a [WeakValueDictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/weakref.html#weakref.WeakValueDictionary) in order for the session to be removed when the user disconnects.

*Line 17* instantiates a global instance of this class.

### Login endpoint

Next we will modify the login endpoint to create a user session:

```py
import logging
import uuid
from typing import Optional, Awaitable

from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import utf8_decode, create_response
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.routing.request_router import RequestRouter

class ChatUserSession:

    def __init__(self):
        self._session: Optional[UserSessionData] = None

    def router_factory(self):
        router = RequestRouter()

        @router.response('login')
        async def login(payload: Payload) -> Awaitable[Payload]:
            username = utf8_decode(payload.data)

            logging.info(f'New user: {username}')

            session_id = SessionId(uuid.uuid4())
            self._session = UserSessionData(username, session_id)
            chat_data.user_session_by_id[session_id] = self._session

            return create_response(ensure_bytes(session_id))

        return router
```

In order to keep a reference to the `UserSessionData` we will modify the request handler factory.
The `ChatUserSession` class will keep the reference to the session data, and define the request routes.

Below is the modified `handler_factory`:

```py
class CustomRoutingRequestHandler(RoutingRequestHandler):
    def __init__(self, session: ChatUserSession):
        super().__init__(session.router_factory())
        self._session = session

def handler_factory():
    return CustomRoutingRequestHandler(ChatUserSession())
```

The `CustomRoutingRequestHandler` class (*Lines 1-4*) is the actual request handler which will wrap the `ChatUserSession` instance.

Finally, we modify the `handler_factory` (*Lines 6-7*) to instantiate the handler and the session.

## Client side

Below is the modified ChatClient:

```py
from rsocket.extensions.helpers import composite, route
from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient

class ChatClient:
    def __init__(self, rsocket: RSocketClient):
        self._rsocket = rsocket
        self._session_id = None
        self._username: Optional[str] = None

    async def login(self, username: str):
        payload = Payload(ensure_bytes(username), composite(route('login')))
        response = await self._rsocket.request_response(payload)
        self._session_id = response.data
        self._username = username
        return self
```

Instead of a greeting from the server, we now receive a session id in the response payload. *Line 14* stores this session on the client class.

We will also store the username on the client for later printing as part of incoming messages.
