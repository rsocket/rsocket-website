The chat application will have various functionality (private messages, channels etc.). Each request to the server will
be identified by a route (similar to paths in an HTTP URL). To implement this we will use the RequestRouter and RoutingRequestHandler
classes.

# Server side

We will place the example from the previous step into a routed request response.

Below is the modified handler_factory method in server.py:

```py
from typing import Awaitable

from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import utf8_decode, create_response
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.routing.request_router import RequestRouter
from rsocket.routing.routing_request_handler import RoutingRequestHandler


def handler_factory():
    router = RequestRouter()

    @router.response('login')
    async def login(payload: Payload) -> Awaitable[Payload]:
        username = utf8_decode(payload.data)

        return create_response(ensure_bytes(f'Hello {username}'))

    return RoutingRequestHandler(router)
```

Line 11 instantiates the <b>RequestRouter</b>. This helper is used as a method decorator to register the route of each request.
It is similar to Flask and Quart syntax.

Lines 13-17 define the login method and attach it to a request-response with the 'login' route. In future steps we will show examples
of the other request types which can be registered.

All methods decorated by the request router accept two optional arguments:
- payload - An instance of a Payload class which contains the data and metadata of the request
- composite_metadata - If rsocket is set up to use composite metadata, this will contain a parsed structure of the metadata in the request payload

Both of these parameters must appear with the exact names as above, as that is how they are passed by the request handler.

Line 19 returns the actual request handler, an instance of <b>RoutingRequestHandler</b>, which uses the request router instance.

# Client side

Let's modify the client side to call this new routed request. For readability and maintainability, we will create a <b>ChatClient</b>
which will wrap the RSocket client and provide the methods for interacting with the server.

Below is the complete code for the new <b>client.py</b> module:

```py
import asyncio

from rsocket.extensions.helpers import composite, route
from rsocket.extensions.mimetypes import WellKnownMimeTypes
from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import single_transport_provider, utf8_decode
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP


class ChatClient:
    def __init__(self, rsocket: RSocketClient):
        self._rsocket = rsocket

    async def login(self, username: str):
        payload = Payload(ensure_bytes(username), composite(route('login')))
        response = await self._rsocket.request_response(payload)
        print(f'Server response: {utf8_decode(response.data)}')


async def main():
    connection = await asyncio.open_connection('localhost', 6565)

    async with RSocketClient(single_transport_provider(TransportTCP(*connection)),
                             metadata_encoding=WellKnownMimeTypes.MESSAGE_RSOCKET_COMPOSITE_METADATA) as client:
        user = ChatClient(client)

        await user.login('user1')
```

Lines 12-19 define our new <b>ChatClient</b> which will encapsulate the methods used to interact with the chat server.

Lines 16-19 defines a <b>login</b> method. It uses the <b>composite</b> and <b>route</b> helper methods to create the metadata which will ensure
the payload is routed to the method registered on the server side in the previous step.

In line 26 we modified the *metadata_encoding* type to be COMPOSITE_METADATA. This is required for routing support.

Lines 27-29 instantiate a <b>ChatClient</b> and call the login method.
