# Request Routing

In the previous step we added a single request-response handler. In order to allow more than one functionality to use this handler,
(e.g. login, messages, join/leave chanel) they need to be distinguished from each other. To achieve this, each request to the server will
be identified by a [route](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket/blob/master/Extensions/Routing.md). This is similar to paths in an HTTP URL where
each URL may handle one of the HTTP methods (eg. GET, POST). To implement this we will use the `RequestRouter` and `RoutingRequestHandler` classes.

See resulting code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-py/tree/master/examples/tutorial/step1)

## Server side

We will modify the example from the previous step into a routed request response.

### Routing request handler

The `handler_factory` method below replaces the `Handler` class from the previous step:

```py
from typing import Awaitable

from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import utf8_decode, create_response
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.routing.request_router import RequestRouter
from rsocket.routing.routing_request_handler import RoutingRequestHandler

def handler_factory() -> RoutingRequestHandler:
    router = RequestRouter()

    @router.response('login')
    async def login(payload: Payload) -> Awaitable[Payload]:
        username = utf8_decode(payload.data)
        return create_response(ensure_bytes(f'Welcome to chat, {username}'))

    return RoutingRequestHandler(router)
```

*Line 10* instantiates the `RequestRouter`. The methods on this helper are used as decorators to register the route of each request
(it is similar to Flask and Quart syntax).

The `RequestRouter` has a decorator method for each RSocket request type:
- `response`
- `stream`
- `channel`
- `fire_and_forget`
- `metadata_push`

All of the above methods receive a single argument, a string representing the route. The decorators may be applied multiple times
which allows for aliases for the same route.

*Lines 12-15* define the login method and attach it to a request-response with the <b>login</b> route.
The method name does not have to match the route.

All methods decorated by the request router accept two optional arguments:
- Any argument named *composite_metadata* (regardless of type-hint), or type-hinted with `CompositeMetadata` will receive a `CompositeMetadata` instance containing parsed composite metadata
- Any other argument without a type-hint, or type-hinted with `Payload` will receive the request's payload

The `RequestRouter` has additional functionality which will be covered in later sections.

*Line 17* returns the actual request handler, an instance of `RoutingRequestHandler`, which uses the request router instance.

### Use the routing request handler

Modify the `RSocketServer` instantiation from the previous example and pass the `handler_factory` method as the *handler_factory* parameter:

```py
from rsocket.rsocket_server import RSocketServer
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP

async def run_server():
    def session(*connection):
        RSocketServer(TransportTCP(*connection), handler_factory=handler_factory)
```

## Client side

Let's modify the client side to call this new routed request. For readability and maintainability, we will create a `ChatClient`
which will wrap the RSocket client and provide the methods for interacting with the server.

### ChatClient class

Below is the complete code for the new <b>client.py</b> module:

```py
from rsocket.extensions.helpers import composite, route
from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import  utf8_decode
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient

class ChatClient:
    def __init__(self, rsocket: RSocketClient):
        self._rsocket = rsocket

    async def login(self, username: str):
        payload = Payload(ensure_bytes(username), composite(route('login')))
        response = await self._rsocket.request_response(payload)
        print(f'Server response: {utf8_decode(response.data)}')
```

*Lines 7-14* define our new `ChatClient` which will encapsulate the methods used to interact with the chat server.

*Lines 11-14* define a `login` method. It uses the `composite` and `route` helper methods to create the metadata which will ensure
the payload is routed to the method registered on the server side in the previous step.

### Test the new functionality

Let's modify the client module to test our new `ChatClient`:

```py
from rsocket.extensions.mimetypes import WellKnownMimeTypes
from rsocket.helpers import single_transport_provider
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP

async def main():
    ...
    async with RSocketClient(single_transport_provider(TransportTCP(*connection)),
                             metadata_encoding=WellKnownMimeTypes.MESSAGE_RSOCKET_COMPOSITE_METADATA) as client:
        user = ChatClient(client)
        await user.login('George')
```

*Line 9* changes the *metadata_encoding* type to be COMPOSITE_METADATA. This is required for routing support.

*Lines 10-11* instantiate a `ChatClient` and call the `login` method.
