This guide will go over step by step of setting up an application using rsocket-py.

## Preface

We will be setting up a chat application with a server and a client.

The chat client will have the following functionality:
- Private messages between users
- Joining and sending messages to channels
- Uploading/Downloading files
- Getting server and client statistics (e.g. number of channels)

The code will be written using only the core rsocket-py code, so that no additional packages need be installed.
Using the Reactivex python extensions may allow for more concise code in some cases.

## Required knowledge

The guide assumes the following knowledge:

* Basic python level (Classes, methods, decorators, dataclasses)
* Basic asyncio usage

## Required setup

Install the rsocket package. See the [pypi package listing](https://pypi.org/project/rsocket/) for installation methods.

## Code

The tutorial code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-py) under <b>examples/tutorial</b>.
