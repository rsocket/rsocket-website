## Preface

import Preface from '../../guide-shared/_preface.mdx'

<Preface/>

In the first steps the code will be written using only the core code.
This results in more verbose code, but prevents the need for additional packages need be installed.
In later steps, [Reactivex](https://rxpy.readthedocs.io) implementation will be added to show more concise code, on both server and client side.

## Required knowledge

The guide assumes the following knowledge:

* Basic python level (Classes, methods, decorators, dataclasses)
* Basic asyncio usage
* Basic understanding of RSocket protocol (See [About RSocket](/about/faq))

## Required setup

Install the rsocket package. See the [pypi package listing](https://pypi.org/project/rsocket/) for installation methods. The tutorial was tested against version 0.4.5.

## Code

The tutorial code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-py) under <b>examples/tutorial</b>.
