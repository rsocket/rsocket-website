This tutorial will go over step by step setting up an application using most of the library's features.

# Preface

We will be setting up a chat application with both a server and client written in python.

The chat client will have the following commands:
- /login (user) (password)
- /logout
- /join (channel)
- /leave (channel)
- /msg (user) (message)
- /upload (filename)
- /download (filename)

# Server side: first steps

Let's setup a simple server which will accept connections and add a user to the list of currently logged in users.
The server will listen on TCP port 6565. Here is the minimum required code:

```py
import asyncio

from rsocket.frame_helpers import str_to_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import create_future
from rsocket.local_typing import Awaitable
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.request_handler import BaseRequestHandler
from rsocket.rsocket_server import RSocketServer
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP


class Handler(BaseRequestHandler):
    async def request_response(self, payload: Payload) -> Awaitable[Payload]:
        return create_future(Payload(str_to_bytes('Welcome to chat')))


async def run_server():
    def session(*connection):
        RSocketServer(TransportTCP(*connection), handler_factory=Handler)

    async with await asyncio.start_server(session, 'localhost', 6565) as server:
        await server.serve_forever()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(run_server())
```

Line 24-25 start a standard TCP server using the asyncio module.

Lines 21-22 define that the response to this session will be an RSocketServer instance.
There is no need to specify anything else here since the RSocketServer starts internal
tasks which listen for incoming data and send outgoing data. The 2 parameters passed are:
- transport : An abstraction for the various supported connection methods. In this case it is an adapter over the created TCP connection.
- handler_factory: A class which defines the handlers for the various requests which will be received over this RSocket connection.

In the handler factory (lines 13-15), a single handler is defined for a 'response' request, which simply welcomes the user.
The payload (data and metadata) of the request are ignored for now. The response is created using helper methods from the rsocket package:
- create_future : The response can be async, This creates a simple future which contains the response data.
- str_to_bytes : All values in a response must be either bytes or bytearrays. This is a simple method which encodes str to bytes.

Next we will look at a simple client which connects to this server

# Client side: first steps

Here is the minimum required client code. The client will connect to the server, send a single "response" request and disconnect.

```py
import asyncio

from rsocket.helpers import single_transport_provider, utf8_decode
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP


async def main():
    connection = await asyncio.open_connection('localhost', 6565)

    async with RSocketClient(single_transport_provider(TransportTCP(*connection))) as client:
        response = await client.request_response(Payload())

        print(f"Server: {utf8_decode(response.data)}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```
