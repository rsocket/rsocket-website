## Application structure

In this step we will set up a minimal code required for both the server and the client.

The application will be composed of 3 modules:
- <b>shared.py</b> - code shared between client and server
- <b>server.py</b> - server side
- <b>client.py</b> - client side and example usage

We will start with <b>server.py</b> and <b>client.py</b>. <b>shared.py</b> will be empty for now.

## Server side

We will set up a simple server to accept connections and respond to the client sending the user's name.
The server will listen on TCP port 6565.

Below is the code for the <b>server.py</b> module:

```py
import asyncio
import logging

from rsocket.frame_helpers import ensure_bytes
from rsocket.helpers import create_future, utf8_decode
from rsocket.local_typing import Awaitable
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.request_handler import BaseRequestHandler
from rsocket.rsocket_server import RSocketServer
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP

class Handler(BaseRequestHandler):
    async def request_response(self, payload: Payload) -> Awaitable[Payload]:
        username = utf8_decode(payload.data)
        return create_future(Payload(ensure_bytes(f'Welcome to chat, {username}')))

async def run_server():
    def session(*connection):
        RSocketServer(TransportTCP(*connection), handler_factory=Handler)

    async with await asyncio.start_server(session, 'localhost', 6565) as server:
        await server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    asyncio.run(run_server())
```

*Lines 21-22* start a TCP server listening on localhost:6565 using [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html).

*Lines 18-19* define that the response to this session will be instantiating an <b>RSocketServer</b>.

The 2 parameters passed are:
- transport : An instance of a supported connection method. In this case it is an adapter over the TCP connection.
- handler_factory: A callable which returns an <b>RSocketHandler</b> instance. This will be used to respond to the client's requests.

There is no need to specify anything else here since the <b>RSocketServer</b> starts internal
tasks which listen for requests, and responds accordingly. The session will close when the connection is lost.

In the example, the handler factory (*Line 12*) is a subclass of <b>BaseRequestHandler</b>.

*Lines 13-15* define a handler for a *response* request which welcomes the user.

The username is taken from the <b>data</b> property of the <b>Payload</b>, and a response is created using helper methods from the rsocket package:
- <b>create_future</b> : This creates a future which contains the response data.
- <b>ensure_bytes</b> : All values in a response must be either bytes or bytearrays. This method encodes string to bytes and assumes utf-8 for the input.

Next we will look at a simple client which connects to this server.

## Client side

The client will connect to the server, send a single *response* request and disconnect.

Below is the code for the <b>client.py</b> module:

```py
import asyncio
import logging

from rsocket.helpers import single_transport_provider, utf8_decode
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP

async def main():
    connection = await asyncio.open_connection('localhost', 6565)

    async with RSocketClient(single_transport_provider(TransportTCP(*connection))) as client:
        response = await client.request_response(Payload(data=b'George'))

        print(f"Server response: {utf8_decode(response.data)}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    asyncio.run(main())
```

*Line 11* instantiates an <b>RSocketClient</b>, and *line 12* sends the request.

The response is a <b>Payload</b> instance, the <b>data</b> of which is printed (*Line 14*).
