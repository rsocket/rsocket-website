# rsocket-py Introduction

:::caution
The python package API is not stable. There may be changes until version 1.0.0.
:::

The python `rsocket` package implements the 1.0 version of the [RSocket protocol](/about/protocol)
(excluding "resume" functionality) and is designed for use in python >= 3.8 using asyncio.

## Guides

See [Quick Start](/guides/rsocket-py/simple) for a short getting started guide, and [Tutorial](/guides/rsocket-py/tutorial) for a more in depth
step by step construction of an application.

Use the [Command-line tool](/guides/rsocket-py/cli) to quickly interact with an RSocket server without writing code.

Other code snippets examples for [Client](/guides/rsocket-py/client), [Server](/guides/rsocket-py/server)
and [RxPy](/guides/rsocket-py/rxpy) integration are also available.

API Documentation (Under construction) is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://rsocket.readthedocs.io/)

## Installing

A pip package is available when installing with
`pip install rsocket` ([rsocket](https://pypi.org/project/rsocket/))

Optionally, install using some extras:

- rx: RxPy3 client
- reactivex: RxPy4 client
- aiohttp: Websocket server/client transport for aiohttp framework
- quart: Websocket server transport for quart framework
- quic: QUIC/HTTP3(wss) support
- cli: Command line interface

## Status

The following are currently implemented:

- RSocketClient / RSocketServer
- Transports:
  - TCP
  - QUIC/HTTP3(wss)
  - Websocket (aiohttp (server/client), quart (server)
- Simple load balancing
- Minimal integration with RxPy (>= 3.x) and reactivex
- Command line interface
