An `rsocket-py` client can be used to communicate with any RSocket Server implemented against the same protocol version as the client,
and which implements the same transport as the client.

Available network transports for `rsocket-py` client include:

- TCP - available by default
- Websocket (aiohttp)

The `RSocketClient` class should be passed an instance of one of the available transports.

To get started creating an RSocket client, you will need to install the [rsocket](https://pypi.org/project/rsocket/) package,
and at least one transport protocol implementation (TCP available by default).

## Client Quick Start Example

```py
import asyncio
from rsocket.rsocket_client import RSocketClient
from rsocket.transports.tcp import TransportTCP
from rsocket.helpers import single_transport_provider


async def main():
    connection = await asyncio.open_connection('localhost', 6565)

    async with RSocketClient(single_transport_provider(TransportTCP(*connection))) as client:
        ... # Execute requests

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Client API

The `rsocket-py` package exposes the following types:

## RSocketClient (class)

`RSocketClient` is used to create an instance of a client. The clients' connection does not initialize until
the `connect` method is invoked, or it is used as a context-manager. It is a subclass of `RSocket`.

### Constructor properties

#### transport (property)

This will typically be an instance conforming to the API of the `Transport` class.

### connect() (method)

This method opens the connection to the peer. Internally this calls `connect()` on the
transport client. See below for the `RSocket` interface.

## RSocket (class)

This interface represents an instance of a rsocket peer-to-peer connection, providing the five
core interactions (fire/forget, request/response, etc.):

### fire_and_forget() (method)

This method sends data/metadata to the server without waiting for a response. The data is
sent immediately.

```py
from rsocket.payload import Payload

def fire_and_forget(self, payload: Payload):
    ...
```

### request_response() (method)

This method sends data/metadata to the server, which returns a single response. The data is
sent lazily when the returned `Future` is resolved.

```py
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from asyncio import Future

def request_response(self, payload: Payload) -> Future:
    ...
```

### request_stream() (method)

This method sends data/metadata to the server, which returns a stream of responses. The semantics
of the stream are application-specific. For example, the stream may represent
updates to a single conceptual value over time, items in an incrementally loaded
list, events, etc. The data is sent to the peer lazily when the returned
`Publisher` is subscribed to and `request(n)` is called to signal demand.

```py
from typing import Union

from reactivestreams.publisher import Publisher
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.streams.backpressureapi import BackpressureApi

def request_stream(self, payload: Payload) -> Union[BackpressureApi, Publisher]:
    ...
```

### requestChannel() (method)

This method establishes an understanding between a client and a server where each intends to send and receive streams
of data from the other. Each actor in this relationship is responsible for signaling to the other that they are ready
to receive data by invoking `request(n)`, where `n` is the max number of payloads the actor is comfortable handling.
Conceptually, `request_channel` can be thought of as two entities 'polling' from each other by signaling to the others
that they are ready to accept `n` number of messages. Inversely, `request_channel` can be leveraged to facilitate
a consistent stream of data transfer payloads between client and server by each (or either)
invoking `request(0x7fffffff)`, where `0x7fffffff` is the max integer value for `int32`.

```py
from typing import Union, Optional

from reactivestreams.publisher import Publisher
from rsocket.payload import Payload
from rsocket.streams.backpressureapi import BackpressureApi

def request_channel(self, payload: Payload, publisher: Optional[Publisher] = None) -> Union[BackpressureApi, Publisher]:
    ...
```

### metadata_push() (method)

This method sends metadata only to the server without waiting for a response. The payload is
sent immediately. This method is not for the direct application usage and should be used to exchange some service level information

```python
def metadata_push(self, metadata: bytes):
    ...
```
