We will be creating a chat application with a server and a client.

The chat client will have the following functionality:
- Private messages between users
- Joining and sending messages to channels
- Uploading/Downloading files
- Getting server and client statistics (e.g. number of channels)

Since the emphasis is on showcasing as much RSocket functionality as possible, some examples may be either a bit contrived, or
be possible to implement in a different way using RSocket. This is left as an exercise to the reader.
