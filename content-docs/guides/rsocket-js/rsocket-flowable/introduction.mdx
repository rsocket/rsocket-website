## Reactive Streams

`rsocket-js` includes an implementation of the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
API in JavaScript. Note that unlike standard Rx Observables, Reactive Streams are
_lazy_, _pull-based_, and support _back-pressure_. Two types are implemented:

- [`Flowable`](./flowable.mdx): An implementation of the Reactive Streams `Publisher` type,
  providing a demand-driven stream of values over time.
- [`Single`](./single.mdx): Like `Flowable`, but resolves to a single value.

rsocket-js public API methods typically return values of these types.
