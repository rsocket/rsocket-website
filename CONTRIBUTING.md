# Contributing

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- This site is powered by [Docusaurus V2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), which requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo.

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Make your changes

Most changes will be expected to be documentation updates in the [markdown docs](/content-docs). If you are changing
more than the Markdown documentation pages, then you should be familiar with comfortable with Node JS, Docusaurus,
and ReactJS.

Review the [Docusaurus v2 docs](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for how to edit Markdown files.

### Open a pull request

When you're done making changes, and you'd like to propose them for review, push your changes to your fork, and then
open a pull request (PR). Inside the PR a Netlify bot will create some Github Checks, as well as build and deploy your
site to a temporary domain.

The `Pages changed - rsocket` check will show you a list of pages Netlify has detected as changing, this can make it
easy to verify only the pages you've edited.

Similarly, the `netlify/rsocket/deploy-preview` check will take you to the root of the temporary domain so that you can
validate the entire site.

Once you've validated your changes feel free to let us know in a comment or by editing your initial comment of the PR.
We should be able to review and merge it quickly.

## Development

### Running the development server

You will need to install the [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) runtime, and then from
within the root of this directory run the following commands:

    npm install
    npm run start

### Forking and Publishing (Likely unnecessary)

You can test your changes or fork and host this site via a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) deployment,
which can be useful for demoing large, Earth shattering, changes in a PR.

From within the root directory, you can run the following command:

```shell script
npx cross-env \
  ORGANIZATION_NAME="YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME" \
  PROJECT_NAME="YOUR_REPOSITORY_FORK_NAME" \
  DEPLOY_URL="https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/" \
  PROJECT_BASE_URL="YOUR_REPOSITORY_FORK_NAME" \
  GIT_USER="YOUR_GIT_USERNAME" \
  npm run deploy
```

In a lot of cases `ORGANIZATION_NAME` and `GIT_USER` will be the same value: your GitHub username, and similarly,
`PROJECT_NAME` and `PROJECT_BASE_URL` will be the same: `rsocket-website`.

These environment variables come from
[Docusaurus v2 deployment guide](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/deployment/), or can be found as shims inside
[docusaurus.config.js](docusaurus.config.js).

The `npm run deploy` command will publish the static site into the `./docs` directory, you'll then need to commit
it so that the site goes live:

```shell script
git add --all
git commit -m "your change"
git push origin $OUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

We use the `docs` folder instead of a branch because long ago we made that decision. If it serves you better to do a
`gh-pages` [branch deployment](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
or to use the native Docusaurus v2 `deploy` [command](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/cli/#docusaurus-deploy), go for it!
